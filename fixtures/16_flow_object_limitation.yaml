# This fixture demonstrates the limitation of "YAML-Lite"
# regarding flow objects (inline mappings/sequences).

# 1. WORKING: Single-line flow object
# The tokenizer captures the entire { ... } as a single scalar.
single_line: { mode: "dark", retries: 3 }

# 2. BROKEN: Multi-line flow object
# The tokenizer stops at the newline after the '{'.
# This results in 'multi_line' having a value of '{' 
# and the subsequent lines being parsed as separate (often invalid) entities.
multi_line: {
  inner: "value"
}

# 3. CORRECT ALTERNATIVE: Standard Block Syntax
# This is how multi-line nesting should be handled in YAML-Lite.
block_syntax:
  inner: "value"
